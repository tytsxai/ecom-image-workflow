# Manager Guide (Phase 1: Images)

## Before you start
- Fill the intake form: [09-输入采集表单-经理填写.md](09-输入采集表单-经理填写.md)
- If you only have supplier images, you can leave the description fields empty.
- If supplier images do NOT include any specs/how-to text, fill section `C1` in the intake form (English text source).
- Recommended defaults: [16-默认配置-一键生成.md](16-默认配置-一键生成.md)

## What you upload
- Supplier product photos (required)
- Optional: product description / reference examples
- Optional personalization:
  - Photo (customer upload)
  - Text (customer input)
  - Logo / graphic (customer input)

## Language rules
- Your instructions can be in English or Russian.
- All text on generated images must be English.

## One-click workflow (target)
1. Upload supplier photos (multiple allowed).
2. Select a Style Pack (Minimal `minimal_white` / Lifestyle `lifestyle_warm` / Premium `premium_dark`).
3. (Optional) Add personalization assets (photo/text/logo).
4. Click Generate → outputs: `Showcase + Specs + How-to`.
5. Review with QC checklist (below). Approve or Reject.

## QC (must pass)
- Product stays the same (shape/structure/color/proportions).
- Background looks clearly different from the supplier image.
- Specs images: same values/units/meaning; different font; different background.
- How-to images: same meaning/steps; slightly reworded allowed; different font; different background.
- Text on images is English only.
